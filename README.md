## Data Collection

The dataset for this project is organized into the following categories:
- `no`: Images without brain tumors.
- `yes/pituitary_tumor`: Images with pituitary brain tumors.
- `yes/meningioma_tumor`: Images with meningioma brain tumors.

## Data Preprocessing

- The images are resized to a common input size of 64x64 pixels.
- Data is split into training and testing sets.
- Image data is normalized for model input.
- Labels are one-hot encoded for multi-class classification (4 classes).

## Model Training

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built using Keras.
- The model consists of Conv2D layers with 'relu' activation functions, max-pooling layers, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- The last layer is a Dense layer with 'softmax' activation for multi-class classification.
- The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- Training is done for 80 epochs with a batch size of 8.

## Flask Implementation

A Flask web application is provided for model testing and predictions.
- The trained model is loaded.
- Users can upload an image for prediction.
- The model predicts whether the uploaded image contains a brain tumor and, if present, classifies the type of tumor.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`.

Your web application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
